# Music is Trivial

## Summary

Do you like trivia? Do you like music? If you answered yes to either of those questions, then we got an app for you.

Music is Trivial is an Android trivia game app to be played once a day just like Wordle. Everyday a new musical artist will appear in the app. Every user gets the same artist on the same day. If you decide to play, you'll see a list of that artists songs. The challenge is to pick this artist's 5 most popular songs and rank them from 1 to 5. After submitting your rankings, you'll be scored on the correctness of your rankings based on song popularity data from Spotify! Open the app tomorrow, and you'll see a new artist so you can play again. Play consecutive days to increase your streak and add to those statistics! Share your daily score to Facebook!

A user will open the app and see an artist. The gameplay involves a list of the most played songs for that artist from Spotify. The user must select what they think are the 5 most listened songs of that artist. Using Spotify's API, we will compare their choices to the 5 most listened songs from Spotify and output how many correct choices were made. The next day, users may play again for a different artist, similar to Wordle. All users get the same music artist every day. Results are optionally shared on social media or using Google Play Games Services API.
