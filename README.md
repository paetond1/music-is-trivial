# Music is Trivial

## Summary

Do you like trivia? Do you like music? If you answered yes to either of those questions, then we got an app for you.

Music is Trivial is an Android trivia game app to be played once a day just like Wordle. Everyday a new musical artist will appear in the app. Every user gets the same artist on the same day. If you decide to play, you'll see a list of that artists songs. The challenge is to pick this artist's 5 most popular songs and rank them from 1 to 5. After submitting your rankings, you'll be scored on the correctness of your rankings based on song popularity data from Spotify! Open the app tomorrow, and you'll see a new artist so you can play again. Play consecutive days to increase your streak and add to those statistics! Share your daily score to Facebook!
