# Music-is-Trivial

## Summary

This is a music trivia game app to be played once a day like Wordle. A user will open the app and see an artist. The gameplay involves a list of the most played songs for that artist from Spotify. The user must select what they think are the 5 most listened songs of that artist. Using Spotify's API, we will compare their choices to the 5 most listened songs from Spotify and output how many correct choices were made. The next day, users may play again for a different artist, similar to Wordle. All users get the same music artist every day. Results are optionally shared on social media or using Google Play Games Services API.
